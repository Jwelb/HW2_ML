This Python script demonstrates how to perform K-Means clustering on synthetic data using scikit-learn's KMeans class. It also uses the KElbowVisualizer from Yellowbrick to help determine the optimal number of clusters (k) and evaluates the clustering results using accuracy and a confusion matrix.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the required Python packages installed:

- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing.html)
- [yellowbrick](https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/install.html)

You can install these packages using pip:

pip install scikit-learn numpy matplotlib yellowbrick




# Quick Start
- Clone this repository or download the kmeans_clustering.py script.

- Run the script in your Python environment.

- Copy code
- python kmeans_clustering.py
# The script will display the following information:

- The best value of K determined using the KElbowVisualizer.
- The accuracy of the clustering results.
- A confusion matrix for the best K.
- Best K
- The script will determine the best value of K using the KElbowVisualizer and print it to the console.

# Best K Accuracy
- The accuracy of the clustering results for the best K is calculated and displayed in the console.

# Confusion Matrix for the Best K
- A confusion matrix for the clustering results with the best K is displayed as an image.
